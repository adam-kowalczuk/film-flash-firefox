# Film Flash

Film Flash is a Firefox-based browser extension that provides a background image, title, and description for a currently-playing movie when a new tab is opened. It was created to gain experience working with manifest.json files, as well as creating and deploying serverless functions via Netlify.

<!-- The project can currently be downloaded [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/film-flash/elgeigpdpdmckhidkiamecaehhmgkdcd) through the Chrome web store. -->
